# Electromagnetic-Waves-Project-Simulations-on-Electromagnetic-Waves
This project involves three main aspects: Creation of 3D Model of Electromagnetic (EM) Waves, Creation of 3D Animation of Electromagnetic (EM) Waves and creation of 3D Models of Incident Wave, Reflected Wave and Transmitted Wave to illustrate the concept of reflection of EM Waves at Normal Incidence from one medium to another.
