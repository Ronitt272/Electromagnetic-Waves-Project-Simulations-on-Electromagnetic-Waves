# Electromagnetic-Waves-Project-Simulations-on-Electromagnetic-Waves
This project mainly involved three aspects: 
1. 3D Model of EM Waves.
2. 3D Animation of EM Waves.
3. 3D Models for the Reflection of EM Waves at Normal Incidence (Transmitted Wave, Reflected Wave and Transmitted Wave)

- Implemented the propagation of Electromagnetic Waves in all the different kinds of media, like Good Conductors, Lossy Dielectrics, Lossless Dielectrics and Air. 
- Designed a 3D model that showed the behavior of the Electric and the Magnetic Fields with respect to time and the propagation of the wave in space.
- Designed a working 3D Animation for the same.
- Implemented the concept of reflection of Electromagnetic Waves at normal incidence from one medium to another.
- The project has been created in such a way that different values of wave parameters can be chosen for different types of media, such as Lossy dielectric, lossless dielectric, air and good conductors, as the code is generalised.

# Wave Equations 

The wave equations are generated with the help of Maxwell’s equations. The wave equations are basically a set of equations that define the propogation of an Electromagnetic medium in any medium based on a number of parameters such as the conductivity of that medium, the permeability in that medium, the permittivity of that medium as well as the relationship between the conductivity in that medium and the angular frequency as well as the permittivity of that medium.

The equations that are finally derived out of the Maxwell’s equations as shown below are the helholtz equations. These equations involve a complex term gamma, In mathematics, the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace operator is known as the Helmholtz equation. It corresponds to the linear partial differential equation.

The wave equations basically define the behaviour of the electric and the magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave in an arbitrary medium. It also provides a relationship between the electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave in any arbitrary medium.

# Classification of Media 

Based on the value of their conductivity, permittivity and permeability, different media can be classified broadly into four categories, in context to electromagnetic waves. These four categories are: Free Space, Lossless Dielectric, Lossy Dielectric and Good Conductors.
