# Electromagnetic-Waves-Project-Simulations-on-Electromagnetic-Waves
This project mainly involved three aspects: 
1. 3D Model of EM Waves.
2. 3D Animation of EM Waves.
3. 3D Models for the Reflection of EM Waves at Normal Incidence (Transmitted Wave, Reflected Wave and Transmitted Wave)

- Implemented the propagation of Electromagnetic Waves in all the different kinds of media, like Good Conductors, Lossy Dielectrics, Lossless Dielectrics and Air. 
- Designed a 3D model that showed the behavior of the Electric and the Magnetic Fields with respect to time and the propagation of the wave in space.
- Designed a working 3D Animation for the same.
- Implemented the concept of reflection of Electromagnetic Waves at normal incidence from one medium to another.
- The project has been created in such a way that different values of wave parameters can be chosen for different types of media, such as Lossy dielectric, lossless dielectric, air and good conductors, as the code is generalised.
